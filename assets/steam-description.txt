[h1]Overview[/h1]

Are you a mod developer who is wishing for a quieter [b]error.log[/b] while you debug with the Machine Shipset active  Then this mod is for you (and me)!  This mod does [b]NOT[/b] redistribute any of the graphics from the Machine Shipset, but does redefine and replace entity asset files in order to eliminate many error messages and some syntax errors.

Along the way, I also added missing particles based on the source definitions (generally from the mammalian or molluscoid ships).  Also missing from several files were the variables defining engine trail length.  Between these two refinements, the Machine Shipset looks nicer than ever.

[h1]Changes[/h1]

Many entity definitions were tweaked to remove (or sometimes add) animations.  "Removed" code was commented out rather than deleted so it should be straightforward to re-enable sections responsible for things for compatibility with NSC, RS, DSS, or ACG.  AryxErin, if you are reading this - feel free to harvest fixes for use in your mod directly.

If anyone wants to read the huge, explicit list I made of the changes, then please visit this mod's GitHub page or view the README.md in its root directory.  With no other mods installed, Machine Shipset generates over 400 lines of error logs on game start.  This mod eliminates all of them by fixing the errors in code.  Should you find that there are still error logs related to the Machine Shipset while playing Stellaris, [i]please[/i] let me know and I will fix them.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]

Will probably cause issues with Machine Shipset compatibility patches for other large mods (New Ship Classes, Downscaled Ships, Real Space System Scale, Aesthetic Cinematic Gameplay).  I don't use any of those mods and did not test for compatibility, but I know that I commented out code related to supporting assets from those mods.  That ensures errors are not generated when they are not installed.

Built for Stellaris version 3.2.* "Herbert."  Not compatible with achievements.
