According to the Paradox Development Studios' "User Modding
Rules of PDS Games" I cannot license this code to you (point
4).

The majority of the code redistributed in this mod was written
by AryxErin and the other authors of the Machine Shipset.  None
of their original art is included in this mod, and the minimum
amount of overwritten text files are included to eliminate error
log messages.

I (Nicholas Butcher) have added missing particle definitions
(reusing predefined particles by PDS) and added a category for
the sound asset.
